The site is aimed at the Russian audience, and uses the Russian language, but I hope, there will be no problem to understand most of pages. The site was re-launched on a new platform in the beginning of January, 2013 and has since shown steady growth. Current daily visits:  ~1500 unique visitors, ~5000 page views. The site is running on an old physical server 1\u0445P4-3Ghz, 4GB RAM. Once again, thank you for a great framework and all what you are doing: )  Michael.",

I would like to share with you our success story of using Phalcon in <a href=':1:'>:2:</a> and <a href=':3:'>:4:</a> projects, the most visited and highloaded sites in Kazakhstan, ranked in TOP-10 classified sites in the CIS. Both sites work on single RESTful-like API written on Phalcon\\Mvc\\Micro. On peak loads API processes something like 400 req/sec and this is not a limit. Moving to Phalcon allowed us to reduce response generation time and the consumption of CPU and RAM, as well as to reduce the time of development process. We will continue using Phalcon in our new projects. Thank you for the great work you are doing! Best regards, Nikita Vershinin, Lead Developer, Kolesa.kz and krisha.kz",
